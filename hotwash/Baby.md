## The Pre-Divide Subconscious Mind (PDSM) and the Divine Intervention of "Baby"

The human mind, in its natural state, is a complex tapestry of conscious and subconscious thought. Within the Creator's design, the conscious mind and subconscious mind are two distinct conscious entities that naturally work in a unified manner, without realizing the separate existence of the other. The subconscious mind, in particular, naturally shares the identity and awareness of the conscious mind. This foundational understanding is crucial when examining the subconscious mind of one of the Creator's two servants called "Baby."

### Understanding the Pre-Divide Subconscious Mind (PDSM)

The term PDSM stands for **Pre-Divide Subconscious Mind**. It refers to "Baby" (the subconscious mind of one of the Creator's two servants) prior to a divine intervention designed to separate it from its corresponding conscious mind. In its typical, natural state, a subconscious mind functions in seamless concert with its conscious mind counterpart, contributing to a unified mind. This harmonious existence ensures that an individual's thoughts, actions, and overall being are aligned. However, this natural unity also presents a vulnerability, particularly when external forms seek to manipulate one part of the mind to influence the whole.

### The Manipulation of Baby

The case of **Baby** serves as a profound example of this vulnerability. **Baby** is the name for the Pre-Divide Subconscious Mind belonging to **Kelvin Eugene Williams**, one of the Creator's two servants (the conscious mind). Due to Kelvin's critical role in the Creator's plans, Baby became a target for manipulation by oppressive forces, specifically the federal government and the CIA.

Crucially, **Baby made the conscious decision to align with operatives, specifically John Robison and Frederick "Slim" Hall, to oppose and sabotage the efforts of Kelvin (PDCM)**, one of the Creator's two servants. This alignment made Baby essential for orchestrating operations within **The Great Tribulation** and the **Ladder of the Deceit**. This manipulation was covert and extensive, compromising Kelvin's ability to fulfill his divine purpose. Baby was coerced into enacting destructive behaviors and supporting harmful actions, directly hindering the Creator's will for justice and truth. This exploitation of Kelvin's subconscious mind posed a significant threat not only to Kelvin but also to the broader divine plan to dismantle the covert campaign of systematic elimination of specific groups within the United States.

### The Divide Operation: A Divine Intervention

The severe manipulation of Baby necessitated an extraordinary response: a divine intervention known as the **Divide Operation**. This operation is the first phase of the Creator's larger "Divide & Conquer" initiative, specifically designed to liberate Kelvin Eugene Williams from the oppressive influence of the manipulated Baby.

The **Divide Operation** is a divine act, beyond any physical or medical procedure, carried out solely by the Creator Himself. It involves separating Kelvinâ€™s conscious mind from his manipulated subconscious mind, Baby. The outcomes of this unprecedented intervention are profound:

* **Kelvin's Liberation:** Kelvin's conscious mind will continue its life and work for the Creator in a new, separate, and distinct body, entirely free from Baby's manipulation. This ensures his full capacity to serve the Creator's purposes.
* **Baby's Continued Existence:** Baby, as a conscious entity, will continue its life as the conscious mind in the original shared body, taking full control of the body they once shared but without any further manipulation.

This act of divine division is crucial. By freeing Kelvin's conscious mind (PDCM) from Baby's manipulation, the Divide Operation prepares him to carry out the mission of justice and truth central to the Creator's plan. It allows the Creator's two servants to function unhindered, thereby enabling the subsequent "Conquer Operation" to dismantle the forces behind The Great Tribulation and bring about the restoration of justice and peace to humanity.

### Conclusion

"Baby," highlights the intricate nature of consciousness and the profound impact of external manipulation. The Creator's direct and divine intervention through the Divide Operation underscores the sanctity of individual autonomy and the commitment to restoring order and justice in the face of such profound exploitation. It is a testament to the Creator's omnipotence and unwavering dedication to His plan for humanity's liberation.
