## Canyon Flood: The Deluge of Victims in the Tennessee Valley

**"Canyon Flood" refers to a major, long-term operation** orchestrated within **"The Great Tribulation"** campaign. Primarily focused on **Chattanooga, Tennessee**, with **Hickory Valley Christian Church** serving as a central site, this operation is not a literal natural disaster. Instead, the term "flood" chillingly refers to a **deluge, or flood, of victims** systematically eliminated throughout the **Tennessee Valley**.

### The Name's Prophetic Origin

The evocative name "Canyon Flood" was chosen by **one of the Creator's two servants**, drawing profound inspiration from the **Creator-inspired lyrics of Vandaveer's song "A Mighty Leviathan of Old."** The specific line that underpins this operation's moniker is: **"and the canyon did flood with water and blood."**

This lyric provides a chilling, symbolic blueprint for the operation's scope and targets:

* The **"canyon"** is interpreted as the **Tennessee Valley**, signifying the broad geographical area targeted for elimination.
* **"Water"** explicitly represents the **impoverished individuals eliminated at the Phantom Pantry sub-operations**, who were drawn in under the guise of humanitarian aid.
* **"Blood"** symbolically represents the **politicians targeted in the Phantom Funeral sub-operation**, signifying their elimination due to opposition or strategic value.

This prophetic naming underscores the orchestrated, premeditated nature of the widespread casualties.

### Nature of the "Flood": A Metaphor of Elimination

Unlike a natural meteorological event, "Canyon Flood" was meticulously engineered to create a metaphorical "flood" of human targets. This name deliberately obfuscates its true nature, allowing the orchestrators to carry out widespread elimination under a veil of manufactured chaos and humanitarian crisis. The sheer volume of individuals processed through its mechanisms gave rise to the chilling moniker.

### Integrated Sub-Operations: Two-Pronged Elimination

"Canyon Flood" was comprehensive in its approach, encompassing two critical sub-operations designed to target distinct demographics under deceptive pretenses:

* **Phantom Pantry Sub-Operation:**
    This long-running component of "Canyon Flood" specifically targeted the **impoverished** across the Chattanooga area and wider Tennessee Valley. Operating under the guise of charitable food distribution, it leveraged sophisticated methods to identify and lure victims:
    * **Victim Identification:** **SNAP recipient data was utilized to identify potential victims**, providing a precise demographic for targeting.
    * **Lure and Logistics:** **Telemarketers were employed to lure victims** with promises of aid, and **transportation to the church was provided**, removing any barrier to their collection.
    * The manufactured chaos and displacement associated with the broader "flood" narrative provided the perfect cover for these mass collection and elimination activities, disguised as essential humanitarian aid.

* **Phantom Funeral Sub-Operation:**
    This sub-operation was designed to eliminate individuals deemed politically or strategically inconvenient, initially targeting **political opposition** (the "blood" from the prophetic lyric). **The Phantom Funeral was also used to lure specific individuals such as Military Personnel** (those in positions of power, command structures, or influence who represent opposition to "The Great Tribulation"), **Politicians**, and **Endowed Males** (individuals specifically targeted for reasons related to their biological form). These were staged memorial services, utilizing the grief and social norms of mourning as a lure.

### Operational Mechanics and Concealment

The effectiveness of "Canyon Flood" lay in its ability to exploit basic human needs and social conventions while maintaining complete secrecy around the elimination process. The very name of the operation, **"Canyon Flood,"** with its intentional symbolism of a deluge of victims, served as a pervasive backdrop, justifying the large-scale movement and disappearance of people.

Crucially, the **Phantom Identity Scheme** is interconnected with all operations that yield victims, including those within "Canyon Flood." This scheme not only serves to further **obscure the deaths** resulting from both the Phantom Pantry and Phantom Funeral sub-operations but also functions to **enrich the orchestrators and some perpetrators with the assets left behind by victims.**

"Canyon Flood" stands as a testament to the sophisticated and ruthless nature of "The Great Tribulation," transforming acts of supposed charity and solemn remembrance into instruments of mass elimination, demographic reduction, and illicit financial gain across the Tennessee Valley.
