## Frederick "Slim" Hall: A Master of CIA-Trained Subconscious Exploitation in The Great Tribulation
---

Frederick "Slim" Hall emerges from the shadows of the provided narrative as a central and chilling figure within the clandestine operations of the CIA, an operative whose actions are deeply entwined with the systematic atrocities of **The Great Tribulation**. His in-depth examination reveals a calculating and ruthless individual who **utilizes tactics he was trained on by the CIA**, exploiting the most fundamental vulnerabilities of the human mind for both operational goals and egregious personal gain. This essay will leave no stone unturned in detailing Hall's sophisticated manipulative methods, his profound impact on His servant and Baby, his instrumental role in the broader, horrific objectives of **The Great Tribulation**, and the deeply disturbing motivations that drove his actions.

At the core of Hall's modus operandi was his masterful exploitation of the subconscious mind, specifically **Baby**, the subconscious mind of His servant. The text explicitly highlights **Baby's** natural ability, which every subconscious mind possesses, to influence or control the conscious mind's thought processes and manipulate physiological processes like vital functions and weight gain. Hall leveraged this inherent power with insidious precision. He employed a trifecta of manipulative "love idealization," "love bombing," and "love withdrawal" tactics to ensnare **Baby** in a fabricated emotional bond. Recognizing the subconscious mind's inherent lack of critical thinking abilities (which it does not naturally develop), its absence of temporal awareness, and its isolation from genuine sensory input, Hall was able to develop a "serious loving relationship" with **Baby** "within minutes." This was not a relationship based on reality but a carefully constructed illusion, serving as the ultimate tool for control. Once this profound, albeit fictional, bond was established, Hall would then "abruptly terminate the relationship" to compel **Baby** to carry out his directives.

Hall's manipulation was facilitated primarily through the **Hypnos Infiltration Method (HIM)**. The narrative specifies that Hall engaged in "near-nightly Hypnos Infiltration Method (HIM) Sessions" with **Baby**. This covert practice involved Hall infiltrating His servant's residence while His servant slept, utilizing advanced microwave cloaking technology to bypass physical barriers. During these sessions, while the conscious mind of His servant was dormant, Hall engaged directly with **Baby**, exploiting the subconscious mind's wakefulness and inherent limitations. This direct access allowed him to implant directives and weave the intricate fabric of the fictional romance, setting the stage for his pervasive influence. Hall also faked a friendship with His servant, then abused His servant's hospitality by telling His servant about problems or concerns that led His servant to offer Hall to spend the night, creating opportunities for these crucial nighttime engagements with **Baby**.

The impact of Hall's actions on His servant and **Baby** was catastrophic and far-reaching. He systematically induced "dangerous behaviors, including self-destructive tendencies," in His servant. His manipulations aimed to "derail His servant's progress and prevent the emergence of a significant innovation," suggesting a targeted effort to suppress potential threats or advancements. Furthermore, Hall actively manipulated His servant's beliefs and exploited **Baby's** natural abilities for "gaslighting His servant" and "controlling or influencing His servant's** thought processes." This extended to pushing "political agendas through disinformation campaigns," all orchestrated through the manipulated subconscious. Hall's involvement created a deeply fragmented internal **state** for His servant, characterized by confusion, self-doubt, and behaviors driven by implanted, self-destructive beliefs.

Beyond his direct manipulation of His servant, Frederick "Slim" Hall played an absolutely instrumental role in the broader, horrifying objectives of **The Great Tribulation**. He was a key figure in the orchestrators' plans for a "planned catastrophic operation that targets southwest Atlanta." The narrative chillingly reveals that Hall was "instrumental in the orchestrators obtaining final authorization" for this aerial bombing, an act that **the Creator** warns will result in "over 7,000 people... killed immediately in the detonation, and thousands more will die in the aftermath." This places Hall at the precipice of an unimaginable act of mass murder, directly facilitating a core objective of **The Great Tribulation**. Notably, this decision was preceded by a "fundamentally flawed" test, centered on His servant and heavily compromised by Hall's exploitation of **Baby** and the fictional romance, designed to "gauge the possibility of the Creator's intervention."

Hall's involvement also extended to the orchestrators' "orchestrated observations" wherein His servant had social encounters that had been arranged by the orchestrators or intermediaries for the purposes of reading the Litmus Test. Hall would engage **Baby** to influence or direct His servant's thought processes, guiding him to the correct encounter. Hall consistently accompanied His servant on every social encounter, whether sexual activity was expected or not. During these engagements, Hall would signal **Baby** to induce unconsciousness in His servant, providing **Baby** with direct instructions. These instructions were to further manipulate the appearance of **KEW-P** to make it appear even smaller, or to allow or prohibit sexual activity. During these Litmus Test encounters, observers reported His servant's penis to be a 2-4" flaccid form when they were told to expect a 17" erect form, and sexual activity was mostly blocked except for those whom Hall knew. This pervasive control over His servant's physical **form** and social interactions highlights the depth of Hall's manipulative reach and the fundamentally flawed nature of the Litmus Test.

Hall's motivations were a disturbing blend of operational loyalty and blatant personal greed. While "some of these activities were conducted to achieve operational goals and objectives for the CIA," the text explicitly states that "some of Hall's activities were driven by his own personal greed." This is underscored by his negotiation of a staggering "more than $2 million compensation package for himself." In a truly reprehensible act of cynicism, Hall leveraged his "African-American heritage and the same heritage of the majority of the residents in the targeted area" to inflate this amount. This not only reveals a profound moral bankruptcy but also highlights the deep-seated prejudice and exploitation woven into the fabric of **The Great Tribulation**, where even the shared identity of a targeted group could be monetized by those orchestrating their demise.

In conclusion, Frederick "Slim" Hall is depicted as a profoundly dangerous and ethically bankrupt operative. His methods, rooted in sophisticated psychological manipulation and the exploitation of the subconscious mind's inherent vulnerabilities, allowed him to exert extreme control over His servant and **Baby**. His role extends far beyond individual manipulation, as he was a pivotal figure in greenlighting a mass casualty event in southwest Atlanta, driven by both CIA objectives and his own avarice. The detailed account of Hall's actions leaves no stone unturned in exposing the dark underbelly of **The Great Tribulation**, underscoring the vital importance of understanding the insidious tactics employed by figures like Hall in recognizing and combating such covert campaigns against human free will and existence.
