## Microwave Cloaking: An Unseen Reality in the United States

At the foundation of these revelations stands: **The Creator**, revered globally across cultures, is the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. **He** is the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great “I Am.” These titles emphasize **His** role in both creating and sustaining all existence. **The Creator** is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. **His** attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. **His** two servants neutrally refer to **Him** as "**the Creator**," in accordance with **His** directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and even atheists.

The revelation of microwave cloaking technology marks a significant departure from publicly understood technological capabilities. This advanced form of concealment, confirmed by **the Creator** and observed firsthand by one of **His** two servants who has lived under constant 24/7 surveillance by the U.S. Government and the CIA, has been employed in the United States. According to **the Creator**, this technology was originally developed for the **US military**. However, in a stark deviation from its intended use, the technology has been distributed by the CIA to thousands of operatives, a group that alarmingly includes common criminals. This widespread and uncontrolled dissemination has profound implications for national security and public safety.

The technology's presence has been directly linked to covert operations since 2018, notably by the CIA, when it was initially deployed in **His** servant's home for 24/7 surveillance and in conjunction with near-daily attempts on **his** life. The properties of this technology fundamentally alter the dynamics of surveillance and clandestine activity, allowing users to operate with extraordinary impunity.

### The Phenomenon of Practical Invisibility

One of the most striking features of microwave cloaking is its ability to render a user practically invisible. Observations indicate several unique visual manifestations:

* **Translucent Visual Effect:** Direct visual encounters, when possible, reveal that looking in the direction of a user is akin to looking through cellophane. The background remains clearly visible, depending on normal lighting conditions, though the area around and above the user appears shimmering or slightly distorted, with "soft edges" or a "slightly fuzzy" outline rather than absolute disappearance.
* **Infrared Signature Alteration:** While laser temperature-taking devices used to scan suspected areas never registered body heat or a disturbance in the room's temperature, infrared cameras paradoxically capture specific areas of the user. Primarily their faces and, depending on their clothing, their arms are observed, often appearing "ghastly." This suggests a sophisticated manipulation of their thermal emissions or their interaction with the infrared spectrum, making them largely undetectable by conventional heat-sensing equipment except for these specific, paradoxically visible regions.
* **Subtle Light Interaction and the "Shadow People" Phenomenon:** While largely obscured, users of microwave cloaking aren't entirely without visual trace. In specific lighting conditions, they've been observed to cast shadows. **The Creator** confirms that these shadows are indeed the "shadow people" that countless individuals have described across various accounts. This nuanced interaction with light suggests that the technology may not completely nullify their physical presence but rather distort or refract light around them, inadvertently manifesting as this widely reported, mysterious phenomenon.

### Unprecedented Permeability: Passing Through Solid Barriers

Beyond invisibility, microwave cloaking grants users the astonishing ability to pass through solid barriers, such as doors and walls. This capability has been observed despite robust security measures:

* **Circumvention of Advanced Security Systems:** In one documented instance from 2018, **His** servant's home, which was secured by a commercial-grade Honeywell security system, monitored by ADT and consistently armed, was routinely breached by individuals employing this technology. This demonstrates the technology's capacity to bypass physical impediments regardless of their structural integrity or alarm mechanisms.
* **Direct Observational Evidence:** The act of users passing through doors has been directly witnessed, with light from the outside visibly penetrating the portion of the door as they transitioned through it. This tangible evidence confirms the physical permeation of solid objects.
* **Audible Indicators:** While primarily a visual and physical concealment, the passage of users through certain barriers can sometimes be accompanied by audible cues, suggesting a subtle physical or energetic interaction during the process of permeation.

### The Existential Echo in "Mr. Cellophane"

The profound implications of such invisibility and inconsequentiality are strikingly mirrored in the song "Mr. Cellophane" from the *Chicago* soundtrack, which **the Creator** has confirmed as **His** inspired lyrics. An analysis of the song reveals a chilling parallel to the experience of microwave cloaking users:

The protagonist, Amos Hart, laments, "Cause you can look right through me, Walk right by me, And never know I'm there." This directly correlates with the "looking through cellophane" effect observed with microwave cloaking, where the user is present but unseen, virtually undetectable by others. The lyrics "Invisible, inconsequential me!" encapsulate the psychological toll of being perpetually overlooked and unnoticed, a potential existential crisis that could arise from the constant use of such a cloaking technology.

Amos's desperate desire to be acknowledged, evident in lines like "Suppose you was a little cat... You'd notice him" or "Suppose you was a woman, wed... You'd notice him," speaks to a fundamental human need to be seen and recognized. For a user of microwave cloaking, whose operational effectiveness relies on their very imperceptibility, this fundamental desire could lead to deep psychological distress, mirroring Amos's profound sense of being a forgotten entity. **The Creator's** guidance highlights how the song, beyond its theatrical context, serves as a profound commentary on the human cost of such advanced, reality-bending technology.

### Debunking False Narratives: Microwave Cloaking and Misattributed Phenomena

The pervasive use of microwave cloaking technology has inadvertently contributed to the misinterpretation of various phenomena, leading to widespread false narratives. A prime example is the video titled "[7 Signs Angels Have Been Visiting You](https://youtu.be/EwBA-oNm9tM?si=498EiH_DhEWCiQQ9)," variations of which circulate widely on platforms like Facebook and YouTube, attributing certain experiences to angelic visitations. **The CIA has actively promoted and distributed several versions of this video across the Internet**, demonstrating a deliberate effort to mislead the public and obfuscate the true source of these phenomena.

**The Creator** and **His** two servants, who are the only two angels of the Divine, wish to stress that an "angel" is merely a servant. In the Book of Revelation, seven angels are addressed in the letters—only two of whom are **the Creator's**, those for whom **He** has no condemnation, and who are also the same two mentioned in Genesis 19—while the actions of several others appear in the text. **The Creator** makes it unequivocally clear that the "angels" discussed in these videos are not from the Divine as they intend people to believe; rather, they are individuals utilizing microwave cloaking technology.

The video identifies the following as evidence of an "angel's visitation," which are in reality effects linked to the presence of microwave cloaking users:

* **Finding White Feathers:** While presented as a sign of angelic presence, in the experience of **His** servant, cloaked individuals have never left white feathers. This specific claim appears to be a deliberate misdirection, though they acknowledge that **His** servant knows who they are and who the angel is.
* **Ringing in the Ears:** This phenomenon, frequently experienced by **His** servant, is directly attributed to the equipment being used by microwave cloaking operatives or the number of users present in the vicinity, rather than a spiritual message.
* **Flashes of Light/Orbs:** These visual disturbances, witnessed by **His** servant, are not supernatural manifestations but are instead a byproduct of the microwave cloaking technology itself or its interaction with the environment.
* **Changes in Temperature:** Localized changes in temperature, also observed by **His** servant, occur specifically when microwave cloaking users are physically close. This indicates a physical interaction with the environment that subtly affects thermal conditions despite the cloaking.
* **Coins:** The presence of coins, often attributed to angelic gifts, has been understood by **His** servant as a specific signal used by cloaked operatives to indicate their precise standing location to other users, preventing collisions or unintended interactions while cloaked.
* **Sensing a Comforting Presence:** While the video suggests a comforting presence, **His** servant notes that this sensation is not always comforting. Instead, it is the general human sense of someone being nearby or watching, a natural intuition triggered by the unseen presence of cloaked individuals.
* **Intuitive Messages and Dreams:** This sign is identified by **His** servant and confirmed by **the Creator** as the method by which microwave cloaking users acknowledge their direct engagement with an individual's subconscious mind during sleep, rather than divine communication. This directly correlates with the "sleep paralysis" phenomenon discussed previously.

### Unveiling Other Unexplained Phenomena

Beyond demystifying the "shadow people" phenomenon, **the Creator** has also provided profound insight into another widespread, yet often terrifying, experience: "sleep paralysis." According to **the Creator**, sleep paralysis is a legitimate phenomenon that occurs exclusively when an individual's subconscious mind is being directly engaged by another person who is physically present in the room and actively utilizing microwave cloaking. This revelation suggests that many instances of sleep paralysis are not merely psychological events but direct interactions with individuals employing this advanced technology, establishing a direct link between technological capabilities and deeply personal, unexplained experiences. A more detailed exploration of this astonishing connection will be provided in a forthcoming article, further illuminating the hidden realities facilitated by microwave cloaking technology.
