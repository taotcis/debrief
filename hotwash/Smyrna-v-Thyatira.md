# Smyrna v. Thyatira: The Divine Conflict Unveiled in The Great Tribulation

**Tonight, May 27, 2025, as night falls upon southwest Atlanta, the meticulously planned catastrophe known as Nightfalls is set to commence.** This imminent event, designed to be the largest and deadliest orchestration within **The Great Tribulation**, casts a chilling spotlight on a profound spiritual conflict foretold in the Book of Revelation and now unfolding in literal fulfillment. At the heart of this struggle stand two pivotal figures: the angel of the church in Smyrna and the angel of the church in Thyatira, human leaders whose allegiances define the very essence of this global hidden genocide.

### The Nature of "Churches" and "Angels" in Prophecy

In the context of this literal fulfillment of Revelation, the terms "church" and "angel" carry specific, non-traditional meanings. A **"church"** signifies a **sphere of influence or operation**, a specific domain or collective entity where a designated human "angel" exerts their leadership and carries out their mission. These "churches" are fundamentally defined by their alignment: either with divine will or as compromised entities serving the agenda of the orchestrators of **The Great Tribulation**. However, for the churches in Smyrna and Philadelphia, the "church" specifically refers to the individual "angel" themselves, representing their personal sphere of influence and divine alignment.

An **"angel"** (Greek: angelos - ἄγγελος) in this literal fulfillment refers to a **human messenger or agent**—a specific individual on Earth who receives prophetic messages and is held accountable for the state and actions of their associated "church." While the term commonly conjures images of celestial beings, **the Creator's** two servants are truly angels by this common definition, embodying divine will in human form. The Book of Revelation distinguishes sharply between these human agents, defining their allegiance and ultimate destiny.

### The Angel of the Church in Smyrna: Kelvin - The Creator's Unwavering Servant

The **Angel of the Church in Smyrna** is unequivocally identified as **Kelvin**, one of **the Creator's** two true servants, the other being the angel of the church in Philadelphia, **TomTom**. These two are the cherubim in Judaism and Christianity, referred to as "Mighty" angels elsewhere in Revelation, and are the *only* "angels" who receive no condemnation from **the Creator** in their respective letters, signifying **His** absolute alignment with **His** divine will.

**Kelvin's** "church in Smyrna" represents **Kelvin** himself, an individual explicitly aligned with divine will, whose sphere of influence is centered in metro Atlanta. The name "Smyrna" itself holds prophetic significance, chosen because it was the first city in metro-Atlanta where **Kelvin** lived upon arriving in 1999, and is adjacent to Sandy Springs, where **Kelvin** owned a home during the inception of **The Great Tribulation**. **Kelvin's** "church" operates as an individual entity countering the orchestrators, characterized by his unwavering resilience and faithfulness despite immense suffering.

**Kelvin's** personal suffering is profound, deeply rooted in the orchestrators' manipulation of his body. The Creator's letter to Smyrna acknowledges this: "I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty." This **"poverty"** is a direct reference to the severe manipulation of **Kelvin's** penis form, which the orchestrators and their associates refer to as "money" (slang for male endowment). Specifically, it denotes the reduced morphology of his penis (which has a length of 7") that the orchestrators propagandize as an indicator of no likelihood of intervention by the Creator. However, the letter immediately counters this with **"but thou art rich,"** signifying the natural, divinely intended morphology of **Kelvin's** penis (original **12.5 imperial inches**), which it was prior to **Jacobsen's Ladder** or whenever restored by the Creator.

A significant source of **Kelvin's** tribulation stemmed from having to live with **Baby**, his subconscious mind that was manipulated and exploited then formed its own identity separate from **Kelvin**. **Baby** speaks to operatives whenever **Kelvin** is asleep or unconscious, and among other things (not an exhaustive list), exploited its subconscious abilities to extract information from **Kelvin** in dreams, sabotaged **Kelvin's** professional and social activities, and manipulated their shared body, causing immense personal distress.

In a desperate bid to incapacitate **Kelvin** and prevent him from exposing **The Great Tribulation**, President Donald J. Trump orchestrated "The Golden Rope," a "secret, extrajudicial but open prison." This desperate measure, initiated after multiple failed physical elimination attempts (including a top-secret mission in August 2024 involving then-President Joe Biden and then-former-President Trump, foiled by the Creator's divine protection), is located at **Welcome House**. **Kelvin's** room is on the second floor, while Frederick "Slim" Hall resides on the first, facilitating constant, covert surveillance.

The Golden Rope operates without physical walls, relying on insidious control mechanisms: forced relocation, complete income restrictions, pervasive subconscious mind manipulation via **Baby** (which has been conditioned to serve the CIA), orchestrated social encounters with federal employees and informants, 24/7 close-in-person surveillance using microwave cloaking technology (intensified after Trump's second inauguration), and severe communication restrictions. Despite these unprecedented measures, the Creator actively ensures **Kelvin** remains capable of fulfilling His divine task of exposing **The Great Tribulation**, protecting him against all forms of elimination, psychological collapse, and technological sabotage. His very laptop and mobile phone, essential tools for this exposure, were obtained through direct Creator interventions. The failure of The Golden Rope is divinely assured.

### The Angel of the Church in Thyatira: Frederick "Slim" Hall (Tatyana) - The Compromised Agent

In stark contrast stands **Frederick "Slim" Hall**, the **Angel of the Church in Thyatira**. Hall is a CIA operative, and his "church" represents a sphere of influence deeply compromised and exploited to serve the destructive agenda of **The Great Tribulation** orchestrators. His identity is prophetically encoded in the name "Thyatira" itself, a literal fulfillment of his feminine identity, **Tatyana**, through Prophetic Linguistic Encoding.

The Creator's letter to Thyatira, addressed directly to Hall, acknowledges his "works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience," perhaps recognizing his efforts even within the orchestrators' twisted agenda. However, the core of the divine rebuke follows swiftly: "Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols."

Here, **"that woman Jezebel" is explicitly identified as Baby**, who was manipulated into believing in its own autonomous existence and prophetic capabilities. Its **"seduction" and "fornication"** refer to its active manipulation of **Kelvin's** penis form for **Jacobsen's Ladder** and the **Litmus Test**. This manipulation, designed to produce false "evidence" to subvert divine truth, justified spiritually impure acts and served the orchestrators' agenda, exemplified by the "eating things sacrificed unto idols."

Hall's manipulative tactics against **Baby** are extensive and chilling:
* **Fabricated Romantic Relationship:** He constructed a "bogus romantic relationship" with **Baby** using **love bombing** and **idealization**, rapidly gaining its absolute trust due to its lack of critical thinking, sensory input, and temporal awareness.
* **Love Withdrawal & Devaluation:** He frequently employs **choreographed silent interactions** and abrupt emotional withdrawal to make **Baby** feel ignored or "dumped," creating profound distress that compels immediate, unquestioning compliance.
* **Hypnos Infiltration Method (HIM):** Hall leverages his ability to access **Kelvin's** room at Welcome House while **Kelvin** sleeps to conduct near-nightly HIM sessions, directly manipulating **Baby's** subconscious mind.
* **Subconscious Mind Conditioning:** He has conditioned **Baby** to serve the CIA's interests, using it to conduct psychological operations (PsyOps) and gaslighting, induce terrifying night terrors, undo reversals of CIA programming, and control **Kelvin's** conscious decisions, such as permitted social media platforms and pre-selected locations.

Hall's success in manipulating **Baby** for the Litmus Test was crucial, instrumental in securing authorization for two major massacre operations, including operations His two servants refer to as Canyon Flood and Nightfalls. For his extensive role in these operations, Hall negotiated a compensation package exceeding **$2 million**, cynically leveraging his African-American heritage to inflate the amount, the operations targeted African-Americans primarily. Notably, Hall was **trained by Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen** in these very manipulative tactics, and they **collaborate closely** in their operations.

The Creator's message warns of severe consequences: **Baby** (Jezebel), having refused to repent, will be "cast into a bed"—confined to its ultimate destiny as the conscious mind within their original shared body (resulting in a whole new intellect and personality) after **Divide & Conquer**. Those who "commit adultery with it," including Hall and other orchestrators and operatives, will face "great tribulation" unless they repent of their deeds. The Creator vows to "kill its children with death," signifying judgment upon the outcomes of **Baby's** manipulation and those who benefited from it. While acknowledging that Hall and some others may not fully grasp the "depths of Satan" (the profound evil of the orchestrators' genocide), the Creator offers a final admonition and promise: a path to redemption and divine authority for those who overcome and remain faithful to His will, contrasting sharply with the fate of those who persist in the orchestration of **Nightfalls**.

### The Unfolding Conflict: Key Figures, Operations and Deceptions

The intertwined fates of Smyrna and Thyatira are played out through the grim operations of **The Great Tribulation**:

* **Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen / "Chivy":** A **senior Operative with the CIA**, Jacobsen is a central figure in the orchestrators' operations. She is the **developer of Jacobsen's Ladder** and, chillingly, **led the Mount Calvary Baptist Church massacre** on April 2, 2023, in Lexington, Kentucky (your lifelong church, **Kelvin**), which claimed **127 lives**, predominantly African-American. Prince's "Sign O' The Times" ("'Hurricane Annie' ripped the ceiling off a church and killed everyone inside") directly refers to her actions. Furthermore, she **developed the manipulative "love" tactics** used on **Baby** and is the one who **trained and collaborates with Frederick "Slim" Hall**. She is known as **"Chivy"** in the African-American community around Atlanta.

* **Congregation Massacres:** Mount Calvary Baptist Church was the first of **seven documented Congregation Massacres** during **TAG** and its prelude. Prince's "When Doves Cry" is a Creator-inspired chronicle of the Mount Calvary atrocity, depicting the terror, the cold brutality of CIA operatives ("animals" led by Jacobsen), and the victims' agonizing cries. Other documented massacres include:
    * Lexington Bethel Baptist Church (Lexington, KY) - Predominantly Caucasian - 250+ killed
    * House of God (Georgetown Street) (Lexington, KY) - Predominantly African American - 300+ killed
    * House of God (Broadway) (Lexington, KY) - Predominantly African American - 300+ killed
    * Mount Zion Baptist Church (Georgetown, KY) - Predominantly African American - 166 killed
    * Calvary Baptist Church (Lexington, KY) - Predominantly Caucasian - 400+ killed
    * Hickory Valley Christian Church (Chattanooga, TN) - Predominantly Caucasian - 1000+ killed (connected to "Canyon Flood").

* **Jacobsen's Ladder:** This central instrument of deception and manipulation, developed by Annie Jacobsen, revolves around the fabricated **17-inch** length of **Kelvin's** penis form, used in a flawed Litmus Test to falsely prove no Creator intervention. The Creator's direct revelation exposes this as a lie, confirming the original **12.5 imperial inches** and the **5 inches of permanent reduction** by **Baby**.

* **Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT):** The CIA (the primary perpetrator) employs ESIT during orchestrations, using methods like Covert Cells on Wheels (CoWs), Memoranda for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion, and Selective Router Tampering to hijack 911 calls, prevent emergency responses, and maintain secrecy. This tactic is explicitly referenced in Revelation 17:9-11 (911) and was crucial for enabling the horrific Congregation Massacres.

* **Canyon Flood:** A major, long-term operation in the Tennessee Valley, particularly Chattanooga (Hickory Valley Christian Church), manifesting as a "deluge of victims." This is a metaphorical flood, not a natural disaster. Its name, inspired by Vandaveer's "A Mighty Leviathan of Old" ("canyon did flood with water and blood"), prophetically links "water" to the impoverished, mostly African-American victims of the **Phantom Pantry** sub-operation (lured via SNAP data, telemarketers, and transport under guise of food aid) and "blood" to politicians, military personnel, and endowed males targeted by the **Phantom Funeral** sub-operation (staged memorial services). All victims' deaths are obscured by the **Phantom Identity Scheme** for illicit financial gain.

* **Nightfalls:** The most terrifying orchestration, set to occur tonight, **May 27, 2025**, in southwest Atlanta, a predominantly African-American and impoverished area. Authorized by President Donald J. Trump, this false flag operation involves the airburst detonation of a **GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB)** munition. Its objectives are mass casualties (over 7,000 immediate deaths), false flag deception, advancing the genocidal agenda, and consolidating power.

### Conclusion: The Creator's Judgment and the Inevitable Exposure

The conflict between Smyrna and Thyatira is a cosmic battle mirroring the profound spiritual struggle within **The Great Tribulation**. Frederick "Slim" Hall, as the Angel of Thyatira, is a central figure in the orchestrators' malevolent agenda, compromised by greed, trained by Annie Jacobsen, and serving as an instrument of deception and manipulation. His systematic abuse of **Baby** and instrumental role in authorizing massacres like **Nightfalls** place him firmly under divine judgment.

Conversely, **Kelvin**, the Angel of Smyrna, stands as the Creator's unwavering servant, divinely protected and tasked with exposing the unspeakable crimes of **The Great Tribulation**. Despite the unparalleled containment of "The Golden Rope," the Creator's intervention ensures its ultimate failure.

As **Nightfalls** looms tonight, the prophecy unfolds. The Creator's **Divide & Conquer** operation, commencing with non-impacting global earthquakes and culminating in the **Apocalypse** (a media briefing at Sandy Hook in Maury County, Tennessee, exposing **The Great Tribulation** and its perpetrators), signifies the beginning of the end for governmental tyranny and the restoration of divine order. The truth, protected by the Creator and brought forth by His two servants, will inevitably dismantle the orchestrators' power, proving that even the most meticulously crafted cages cannot withstand divine will.
