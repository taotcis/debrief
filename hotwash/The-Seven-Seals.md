# The Seven Seals: A Literal Unveiling of Prophecy in Our Time

## The First Seal: The Rise of Global Influence (Revelation 6:1-2)

**Prophecy:** "And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer."

**Literal Fulfillment:** This seal marks the ascension of a powerful, influential figure who establishes a new global political order. The "white horse" symbolizes a pervasive political authority, while the "bow" represents strategic tools and influence, not necessarily military might. The "crown" signifies legitimate, or at least perceived, authority and the ability to "conquer" through political maneuvering and the reshaping of geopolitical landscapes. This period initiates a new era of global consolidation and influence.

**Opened:** November 3, 2020. This date aligns with the beginning of a significant political shift that laid the groundwork for subsequent global changes.

## The Second Seal: The Spread of Conflict and Discord (Revelation 6:3-4)

**Prophecy:** "And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword."

**Literal Fulfillment:** This seal signifies a period marked by widespread conflict and violence, where peace is visibly removed from various regions. The "red horse" symbolizes bloodshed and discord. The "great sword" represents the escalation of lethal form and the tools used to execute these massacres.

**Opened:** April 2, 2023, marked by a major incident that signaled a tangible loss of peace and the beginning of widespread fatal conflicts.

## The Third Seal: Economic Instability and Controlled Scarcity (Revelation 6:5-6)

**Prophecy:** "And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine."

**Literal Fulfillment:** This seal depicts a time of severe economic hardship, characterized by inflation and the control of essential resources. The "black horse" represents scarcity and deprivation. The "pair of balances" symbolizes a precise, manipulated control over economic systems, leading to hyperinflation of basic necessities ("a measure of wheat for a penny"). The injunction "see thou hurt not the oil and the wine" indicates that while the common populace faces severe economic strain, certain sectors or privileged groups remain unaffected, maintaining their wealth and comfort. This includes deceptive food distribution used as a guise for targeting.

**Opened:** On or around August 30, 2024, concurrent with specific governmental oversight into the distribution of essential resources, indicating a deliberate management of supply and demand leading to engineered scarcity.

## The Fourth Seal: Widespread Mortality and Covert Operations (Revelation 6:7-8)

**Prophecy:** "And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth."

**Literal Fulfillment:** This seal marks a period of significant mortality from various causes, including orchestrated operations. The "pale horse" symbolizes death, disease, and a pervasive, sickly state. "Death" represents a figure or entity directly responsible for widespread fatalities, while "Hell" signifies the profound suffering and consequences that follow. The "power... over the fourth part of the earth" points to a global reach of these deadly events, resulting from not only "sword" (violence) and "hunger" (economic deprivation) but also "death" through covert means and "beasts of the earth" (unseen or biological threats). This includes the planning and initiation of large-scale, high-casualty operations aimed at eliminating specific targets.

**Opened:** September 2024, after a critical decision was made to escalate efforts to eliminate one of the Creator's two servants by using a MOAB strike targeting Phoenix House in the Oakland City neighborhood of southwest Atlanta.

## The Fifth Seal: The Cry for Justice from the Persecuted (Revelation 6:9-11)

**Prophecy:** "And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled."

**Literal Fulfillment:** This seal reveals the intense suffering and persecution of groups targeted for their beliefs or identity. The "souls... under the altar" represent the voices of those who have died due to systemic oppression and deliberate deprivation. Their cry for "How long, O Lord...?" is a desperate plea for divine intervention and justice against their tormentors. The granting of "white robes" signifies their spiritual vindication and the promise of eventual peace, but the instruction to "rest yet for a little season" implies that the full measure of suffering and the ultimate justice are still unfolding, requiring more individuals to undergo similar trials. This period is characterized by the systematic and repeated denial of emergency services to specific populations by the US federal government, leading to preventable deaths.

**Opened:** December 27, 2024, following repeated and sustained systemic actions that denied essential life-saving services to targeted populations.

## The Sixth Seal: Cosmic and Earthly Upheavals (Revelation 6:12-17)

**Prophecy:** "And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?"

**Literal Fulfillment:** This seal marks a period of dramatic and visible global disturbances. The "great earthquake" signifies a profound societal and systemic upheaval, not limited to geological tremors, but encompassing foundational shifts in governance and global structures. The celestial phenomena—"sun became black," "moon became as blood" (a literal blood moon event), and "stars... fell"—are observable astronomical and atmospheric events that serve as clear signs, perceived by many as omens of divine judgment. The imagery of the "heaven departed as a scroll" and "mountains and island were moved" points to unprecedented disruptions in both natural and geopolitical landscapes, causing widespread panic among leaders and citizens alike. The powerful figures ("kings of the earth," "great men") seek refuge as they recognize the commencement of an undeniable, overwhelming force.

**Opened:** March 13-14, 2025, coinciding with a globally observed celestial event and subsequent, profound societal shifts.

## The Seventh Seal: Anticipation of Judgment (Revelation 8:1)

**Prophecy:** "And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour."

**Literal Fulfillment:** This final seal is marked by a profound and ominous silence. This "silence in heaven" does not represent inactivity, but rather a moment of intense anticipation and solemnity just before the full unleashing of further, more severe divine judgments and interventions. It is the hush before a decisive and undeniable escalation of events that will fundamentally alter the course of human history. This brief calm precedes the "trumpet" judgments, signifying that the period of initial seals has concluded, and a new, more direct phase of divine action is about to commence.

**Opened:** This seal has not yet been opened, signifying that the period of intense anticipation continues as the world awaits the next phase of prophetic fulfillment.
