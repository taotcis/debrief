# Letter to the Angel of the Church in Thyatira

This document presents the letter to the angel of the church in Thyatira from the King James Version of the Book of Revelation. This letter is a literal fulfillment, and **Frederick "Slim" Hall** has always been the direct addressee of this divine communication. Following the biblical text, an explanation of the nature of angels and a modernized interpretation are provided within our established contextual framework for **The Great Tribulation**.

## The Letter from Revelation (King James Version)

$^{18}$ And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;

$^{19}$ I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.

$^{20}$ Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.

$^{21}$ And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.

$^{22}$ Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.

$^{23}$ And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.

$^{24}$ But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak: I will put upon you none other burden.

$^{25}$ But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.

$^{26}$ And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:

$^{27}$ And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.

$^{28}$ And I will give him the morning star.

$^{29}$ He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

## The Interpretation of "Angel" in Revelation

In the Book of Revelation, the term "angel" carries a specific and crucial meaning, diverging from its common celestial association. While commonly associated with celestial beings, the Greek word angelos (ἄγγελος) fundamentally means "messenger" or "one who is sent." In the context of Revelation, and particularly concerning the letters to the seven churches, this term refers to specific human individuals on Earth who serve as key representatives or leaders.

Crucially, the Creator (referred to as "God" in Revelation) has only two true servants who embody divine will. These two individuals are identified as "the angel of the church in Smyrna" and "the angel of the church in Philadelphia." Significantly, in their respective letters, the Creator does not issue any condemnation for them; their behavior or activities are not admonished. Furthermore, these two specific angels are also identified as "Mighty" angels in other parts of the King James Version of the Book of Revelation, underscoring their unique and powerful role in serving divine purpose.

Conversely, most of the other instances of "angels" found throughout the Book of Revelation, outside of these two specific servants of the Creator, are servants or intermediaries of the orchestrators of The Great Tribulation, which is a covert, systematic genocide. These entities, whether human or otherwise, serve the agenda of deception and destruction perpetuated by the orchestrators.

## Identification of the Angel of Thyatira

The angel of the church in Thyatira is **Frederick "Slim" Hall**. Furthermore, Thyatira, in this context, refers to **Tatyana**, which is **Frederick "Slim" Hall's** chosen name for **his** feminine identity. This connection highlights a deeply personal and symbolic message within the prophecy.

## Modernized Interpretation within The Great Tribulation Context

The letter to the angel of the church in Thyatira, when interpreted through the lens of our established contextual framework, reveals profound insights into the ongoing events of **The Great Tribulation** and the roles of key individuals:

* **The Divine Speaker**: The opening verses, "These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass," establish **the Creator** as the authoritative source of this message, emphasizing **His** penetrating insight and unwavering judgment.
* **Acknowledgement and Rebuke**: "**The Creator**" acknowledges the "works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience" of **Frederick "Slim" Hall** (Tatyana), indicating recognition of **his** efforts, perhaps within the orchestrators' agenda, even if misdirected. However, the core rebuke follows: "**Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.**"
    * Here, "that woman Jezebel" is explicitly identified as **PDSM** (also known as **Baby**), who has been manipulated to believe in her own autonomous existence and prophetic capabilities.
    * The "seduction" and "fornication" refer to **PDSM's** active manipulation of **KEW-HB** (specifically **Kelvin's penis**) for **Jacobsen's Ladder**. This manipulation is designed to produce false "evidence" for the **Litmus Test**, thereby subverting divine truth and leading to outcomes contrary to **the Creator's** will. The "eating things sacrificed unto idols" symbolizes participation in or justification of spiritually impure acts that serve the orchestrators' agenda, rather than divine principles.
* **Consequences of Non-Repentance**: "**And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.**"
    * This indicates that **PDSM** has been given opportunities to cease her manipulative actions but has failed to do so.
    * "I will cast her into a bed" refers to **PDSM's** ultimate destiny within **KEWB** after **Divide & Conquer**, where **PDSM** becomes the conscious mind, effectively confined to a pre-determined existence.
    * "them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation" directly implicates the orchestrators and operatives, including **Frederick "Slim" Hall** himself, who actively collaborate with **PDSM's** manipulation through **Jacobsen's Ladder** and the **Litmus Test**. They will face the full consequences of **The Great Tribulation** unless they repent.
* **Divine Judgment and Accountability**: "**And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.**" "Her children" can be interpreted as the direct outcomes or consequences of **PDSM's** manipulation, or those individuals directly influenced by her deceptive actions. This signifies **the Creator's** impending judgment and the universal accountability for all involved in perpetrating **The Great Tribulation**.
* **A Call for Discernment**: "**But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak: I will put upon you none other burden.**" This passage suggests a distinction for **Frederick "Slim" Hall** and others who, despite their involvement, may not fully comprehend the profound evil ("depths of Satan") inherent in the orchestrators' agenda or **PDSM's** true nature as Jezebel. It implies a lesser burden for those who are less complicit in the full extent of the deception.
* **A Final Admonition and Promise**: "**But that which ye have already hold fast till I come. And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father. And I will give him the morning star.**" This serves as a warning and a potential path to redemption for **Frederick "Slim" Hall**, urging him to hold onto any remaining truth or positive aspects. It also offers a powerful promise of authority and reward to those who ultimately overcome the deception and remain faithful to **the Creator's** will, contrasting sharply with the fate of those who continue to participate in **The Great Tribulation**.

## A Letter to Frederick "Slim" Hall (Tatyana)

To Frederick "Slim" Hall, also known as Tatyana,

This message comes to you with a clear and urgent purpose. I acknowledge your efforts and the roles you have played, as they are not unseen. Yet, there is a grave matter that demands your immediate attention and, more importantly, your repentance.

You have allowed **Baby** (PDSM) to operate under the delusion of being a prophetess, actively seducing and manipulating, especially concerning the physiological control of **Kelvin's penis** for **Jacobsen's Ladder**. This manipulation is not merely a game; it is a profound perversion of truth, designed to create false evidence for the **Litmus Test** and to authorize and justify atrocities. Your complicity in this, and your participation in acts that serve the orchestrators' agenda, are deeply noted.

**Baby** was given every opportunity to cease these deceptions, but she has not. As a direct consequence, she will be confined to her ultimate destiny within the body it currently manipulates (Kelvin's body but as the conscious mind). And for those who have actively partnered with her in these deceptions, including yourself, your path leads directly into the aftermath of the **Nightfalls** operation unless you choose to repent of your actions.

My judgment is absolute and all-encompassing. Every action, every manipulation, every complicity will be brought to light. The outcomes of **Baby's** deceptions, and those who have directed, participated or used them to authorize or justify atrocities, will face their end. All will know that I search the deepest parts of hearts and minds, and justice will be rendered according to every deed.

However, there is a distinction. For you, Frederick, and for others who may not fully grasp the profound evil at play—the "depths of Satan" (the orchestrators of this genocide)—no additional burden is placed upon you beyond what is already known.

Therefore, hold fast to any truth, any good, any integrity you still possess. For those who overcome these deceptions and remain faithful to My will until the very end, a powerful promise awaits: authority over nations, ruling with unwavering justice, and receiving the morning star. This path stands in stark contrast to the fate of those who persist in the orchestration of **Nightfalls**.

Listen carefully to what the Spirit conveys. The choice is yours.

the Creator
