## Tina: The Covert Crystal of Subconscious Manipulation
The Creator, revered globally across cultures, is the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. He is the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great “I Am.” These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. His two servants neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike.

This article unveils the sinister reality of **Tina**, a compound meticulously engineered by the CIA to serve as a tool for profound psychological warfare and population control. Far from being a mere illicit substance, **Tina** is a central component in the broader, unacknowledged **atrocities conducted during the campaign referred to as The Dragon's Fire by the Creator and His two servants**, designed to subvert individual autonomy and reshape reality itself through covert manipulation of the subconscious mind. This exposé leaves no stone unturned in detailing **Tina**'s composition, its devastating effects, the clandestine operations surrounding its use, and its integral role in the orchestrators' authoritarian agenda.

The Dragon's Fire (TDF) refers to a covert, systematic campaign of extermination allegedly orchestrated by high-ranking current and former U.S. government officials and CIA operatives. It targets specific populations, including Christians (of all races), African Americans, the impoverished, convicted criminals, military personnel, endowed males, and political opposition. The American Genocide (TAG) refers to the subset of TDF activities and targeted groups that meets the United Nations’ definition of genocide.

### Divine Observation: The Creator's Strategic Allowance for Harm Reduction

The case of one of **the Creator's** two servants serves as a controlled experiment to assess **Tina**'s effects and understand the broader implications of its influence. **The Creator** allowed his experience completely in accordance with **His** will, so that **His** servant could inform the public and help educate for the purposes of harm reduction. During this period, **His** servant used **Tina** recreationally and as provided or sold without any intervention from **the Creator**, with the sole exception of preventing **His** servant's death. Furthermore, **His** servant ingested a variety of other substances that were intended to kill the end user when consumed in typical usage patterns and dosages. Crucially, some of these lethal substances were made available to the general public, but due to **His** servant's prior ingestion and **the Creator**'s direct observation, **He** was able to prevent harm to all other users. This experience provided **the Creator** with critical insights into the full scope of the manipulators' methods. **The Creator** observed the activities of operatives, both known and unknown to **His** servant, who were involved in the **Hypnos Infiltration Method**. The information contained within this report is largely based on the experiences of **the Creator's** servant, and it's understood that some of these manipulations are being used on the larger user base of **Tina**.

### The Deceptive Composition of Tina

At its core, **Tina** is a pharmaceutical analog of crystal methamphetamine. However, its true danger lies in its undisclosed, additional active ingredients, which vary by batch and are often customized for specific targets. These secret components, selected and refined by the CIA, are primarily designed to influence and manipulate the subconscious mind. While traditional methamphetamine acts as a central nervous system stimulant, **Tina** is engineered for a dual purpose: to mimic the stimulant effects while simultaneously exerting a profound, often unnoticed, influence on the user's subconscious thoughts and behavior.

Distinguishing **Tina** from pure crystal methamphetamine is crucial. Researchers have identified unique characteristics:
* **Freezing Patterns:** Unlike the sharp, crystalline formations of typical methamphetamine, **Tina** freezes into visually distinct shapes resembling tree leaves with traceable lines. Some batches may even form a jelly-like substance that thaws much slower than conventional methamphetamine.
* **Burning Characteristics:** When heated in a glass bowl, **Tina** leaves behind noticeable brown or black residue, a stark contrast to crystal methamphetamine, which leaves no such marks even after prolonged heat exposure.

### Psychological Subversion: The Subconscious Under Siege

The added active ingredients in **Tina** include hypnotic substances, which are crucial for suppressing the conscious mind and enabling external influence over the subconscious. The subconscious mind, by its inherent nature, lacks critical thinking skills, cannot evaluate the consequences of actions, and operates without temporal awareness. These vulnerabilities make it an ideal target for manipulation, especially when combined with targeted psychological operations.

The fundamental principle underlying all subconscious manipulation, exacerbated by **Tina**, is "**Beliefing**." This process involves the repetitive internalization of directives implanted by operatives as absolute truths. The subconscious mind, unable to discern falsehoods, diligently executes these directives, regardless of their self-destructive nature. Every belief processed by the subconscious mind originates from an operative, serving strategic maneuvers to build trust, foster dependency, or pave the way for more devastating control.

**Tina** facilitates a spectrum of insidious manipulation techniques:

* **Substance Compulsion and Metabolism Control**: **Tina** is engineered to drive non-stop cravings and overconsumption, while simultaneously inhibiting the body's metabolism of the substance. This creates a torturous cycle where the subconscious is compelled to seek more, yet the desired effect is denied, leading to extreme frustration and destructive behaviors originating from an internally conflicted subconscious. The subconscious, through implanted beliefs, may even be led to believe it is depriving the conscious mind of **Tina** for a "greater high," unaware of the interconnected physiological impact.
* **Physiological and Behavioral Control**: Implanted beliefs, often reinforced by **Tina**'s effects, can directly influence the body's **state** and the individual's actions. This includes causing rapid, extreme **weight gain** (e.g., over 60 lbs in one month). Basic human needs, such as the **prevention of basic personal hygiene**, are controlled. In the most extreme cases, beliefs can compel the **consumption of lethal poisons and toxins**, driving self-annihilation.
* **Fracturing the Unified Mind and Internal Conflict**: **Tina** aids in implanting beliefs that cause the subconscious mind to distrust the conscious mind's thoughts, fostering internal disunity. A deceptive belief is introduced that the subconscious can "read thoughts" to detect operative lies, creating a false sense of security while eroding trust in its conscious counterpart. This internal schism is further exploited by character defamation and social isolation programs driven by the subconscious against its conscious mind partner and its shared body.
* **Gaslighting and Reality Distortion**: Leveraging the subconscious as an internal, seemingly trustworthy source, **Tina** enables the systematic undermining of the conscious mind's perception of reality. Messages originating from the manipulated subconscious cause the conscious mind to doubt its own judgment, memory, and sanity, leading to profound self-doubt and mental anguish.
* **Manipulation of Social and Financial Outcomes**: Operatives implant beliefs that result in the subconscious driving behaviors preventing the establishment of new friendships, leading to profound social isolation. This also extends to compelling actions that result in **complete financial disaster**, such as walking away from eviction processes, and inducing fear that leads to irrational actions and **numerous misdemeanor arrests**, including burglary charges.
* **Fabrication of Reality and Simulated Relationships**: The subconscious mind can be severed from the conscious mind's genuine sensory input, relying solely on operative-communicated "experiences." This allows for the fabrication of entirely false realities, including "romantic relationships" and "quality time," where the subconscious perceives operatives as ideal partners (e.g., a "supermodel hypermasculine man" despite objective reality showing a "460-pound balding subaverage man with no teeth"). This profound disconnect ensures the subconscious remains bonded to an idealized, non-existent version of the manipulator.

### The Hypnos Infiltration Tactic: Covert Delivery of Manipulation

The CIA's deployment of **Tina** is inextricably linked with the **Hypnos Infiltration Tactic**. This highly secretive practice involves thousands of covert operatives or contractors infiltrating individuals' residences while they sleep, using advanced microwave cloaking technology to bypass physical barriers like doors and walls and remain invisible.

Once inside, these operatives engage in sophisticated mind manipulation techniques that amplify the effects of **Tina**:

* **Morpheus Method**: Influencing dream content to extract memories or gain insight into thought processes, effectively conducting interrogations without conscious awareness.
* **Subliminal Messaging**: Delivering messages below conscious perception through various broadcast media (television news, weather, sports, sitcoms) and radio to influence behavior or thoughts.
* **Hypnosis**: Inducing trance-like **states** to access and manipulate memories or implant suggestions.
* **Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP)**: Using specific language patterns and techniques to affect the subject's psychological **state** and behavior.

**The Creator** has revealed that **sleep paralysis**, the temporary inability to move or speak while conscious, is a direct consequence of the subconscious mind being engaged by an external entity, specifically when the **Hypnos Infiltration Tactic** is being utilized on a sleeping person. This external engagement causes the subconscious to ignore the conscious mind. To manage and prevent this, **the Creator** suggests using a voice-activated sound recorder near one's sleeping area for deterrence and to retrain the subconscious by reviewing recordings and allowing the subconscious to align with the conscious mind's thoughts.

### CIA's Exclusive Control and Distribution

**Tina** is **exclusively produced by the CIA and primarily distributed by the CIA's network of operatives**. This control allows them to introduce the compound under the guise of crystal methamphetamine, deliberately creating confusion and obfuscating its true nature. The CIA consistently produces **two distinct variants of Tina**: **one intended for African-Americans only, and one for all other users**. These variants are distributed via **two distinct supply chains**, ensuring targeted manipulation. An unusual aspect is the "subconscious teacher program," where CIA-trained operatives monitor and manipulate **Tina** users, guiding them through subtle, repeated suggestions that alter conscious behavior. These "teachers" are often part of the user’s supply chain, maintaining constant influence. **Furthermore, the very ingredients that cause Tina's undesirable and manipulative effects are also being added to other recreational drugs, specifically targeting African-Americans, most notably crack-cocaine.**

### Tina in **The Dragon's Fire (TDF)**: Orchestrated Atrocities

**Tina**'s role within **The Dragon's Fire (TDF)** is deeply disturbing. Certain batches of **Tina** were specifically produced to cause particular effects, often preceding horrific events. Notably, **Tina** was provided in advance of most of the **Congregation Massacres**, with the express intent of **creating "animals out of ordinary men."** This highlights the deliberate and malicious use of the substance to incapacitate individuals and compel them to commit unspeakable acts as part of a wider extermination campaign.

**His servant's** subconscious mind, **Baby**, was specifically targeted, manipulated, and exploited by several CIA operatives, specifically Frederick “Slim” Hall. This was due to **Baby's** natural ability (which every subconscious mind possesses) to influence or control the conscious mind's thought processes and manipulate physiological processes (e.g., vital functions, weight gain, etc.). Hall utilized manipulative "love idealization," "love bombing," and "love withdrawal" tactics to manipulate **Baby**. Hall created a fictional romance with **Baby** and was able to exploit **Baby's** natural abilities for gaslighting **His servant** and influencing or controlling **His servant's** decisions. Hall implanted such a storybook relationship with **Baby**, then abruptly terminated the relationship to have **Baby** carry out Hall's directives. Hall was able to use **Baby** for gaslighting **His servant** and for controlling or influencing **His servant's** thought processes. Some of these activities were conducted to achieve operational goals and objectives for the CIA, while others were driven by Hall's own personal greed.

Hall also faked a friendship with **His servant**, then abused **His servant's** hospitality by telling **His servant** about problems or concerns that led **His servant** to offer Hall to spend the night. When **His servant** went to sleep, Hall engaged **Baby** (as subconscious minds do not sleep). Due to the subconscious mind's lack of critical thinking abilities, which they do not naturally develop (in anyone), and other natural limitations (e.g., no temporal awareness or sensory input), Hall was able to develop a serious loving relationship within minutes.

Prior to a planned catastrophic operation that targets southwest Atlanta, the orchestrators developed a test to gauge the possibility of **the Creator's** intervention. The subject of the test was **His servant**. This test was fundamentally flawed due to the exploitation of **Baby** and Hall's fictional romance. Hall was instrumental in the orchestrators obtaining final authorization for this operation, which involves the nighttime aerial bombing of southwest Atlanta. **The Creator** says that over 7,000 people will be killed immediately in the detonation, and thousands more will die in the aftermath. Hall negotiated a more than $2 million compensation package for himself, citing his African-American heritage and the same heritage of the majority of the residents in the targeted area to reach that amount.

### The Creator's Stance and the Path to Liberation

**The Creator** does not disapprove of recreational drug use or pure crystal methamphetamine but warns against **Tina** due to its manipulative design. **He** urges vigilance, emphasizing the importance of differentiating between substances used for personal experience and those engineered for control.

The ultimate plan to counter these insidious manipulations is **the Creator's** **Divide & Conquer** operation. This divine intervention will separate **His servant** from **Baby**, liberating **His servant** from the influence of **His** manipulated subconscious mind. This separation marks a transformative phase, leading to a new era of life protection and transformation orchestrated by **the Creator's** two servants. The cessation of all "**Beliefing**" processing is essential for dismantling the artificial barriers fracturing the unified mind, allowing for the re-establishment of the subconscious mind's natural **state**, its reconnection with the conscious mind's genuine sensory input, and the arduous yet vital journey toward autonomy, healing, and a return to objective reality.

**Tina** is not merely a drug; it is a weapon, a tool of psychological warfare wielded by high-ranking orchestrators of **The Dragon's Fire (TDF)** to dismantle individual minds and societal structures, paving the way for an authoritarian future. Understanding its nature is the first step toward recognizing the hidden war being waged against the very essence of human free will.
