# Public Report: The Use of Chemical Dissolution as a Body Disposal Method During The American Genocide (TAG)

## Introduction
This report is issued as part of the Creator's intervention in the fight against **The American Genocide** (TAG), a covert, systematic campaign directed at orchestrating the mass extermination of targeted groups. It reveals classified and closely-guarded information to bring the truth to light, raise public awareness, and hold perpetrators accountable for their actions.

Among the atrocities committed, the perpetrators employed a deceptively simple yet highly effective method for disposing of bodies. The method involves the use of a powdered chemical, mixed with water, to dissolve human remains—leaving only pulverized bone fragments. This report outlines the procedure, its implementation, and the implications of its use within the broader context of the genocide.

## The Chemical Dissolution Process

### 1. **Preparation of the Solution**
The process begins with the use of a powdered chemical, carried in a standard oversized backpack. This chemical is mixed with ordinary tap water in a bathtub or baptismal, creating an alkaline solution capable of dissolving human tissues. The simplicity of the required equipment belies the method’s devastating effectiveness.  

- **Materials Needed**  
   - A powdered chemical (easily carried in an oversized backpack)
   - Tap water (from any standard faucet)
   - A water-filled structure (bathtub, baptismal)

- **Procedure**  
   The chemical is mixed with water to form a potent solution, strong enough to break down human tissue within hours. The need for external energy or heat is eliminated, making the method portable, adaptable, and efficient.

### 2. **Submersion and Chemical Reaction**
Once the solution is ready, the bodies of up to three full-sized adults are submerged. The chemical reacts with the body, dissolving all soft tissues into liquid form. The process typically takes several hours.  

- **Dissolution of Soft Tissue**  
   The alkaline solution rapidly breaks down organic materials, including muscles, organs, and skin, leaving only the bones behind. The process is largely passive, requiring no intervention once the body is submerged.

### 3. **Bone Fragment Processing**
After the dissolution of the soft tissue, the remaining bones become brittle and soft. They are left intact but can be easily crushed or pulverized into a fine powder or gravel-like substance. This step ensures that no large remnants are left behind to be discovered.

- **Pulverization of Bone Fragments**  
   The bones are crushed into a fine powder, similar to gravel found on the side of a road, making it nearly impossible to distinguish the remnants from common road debris.

### 4. **Effluent Disposal**
The solution, now containing dissolved tissue, can be safely drained into a plumbing system, leaving no trace of the bodies once the solution is disposed of. The liquid byproduct is sterile, non-toxic, and unlikely to leave any lasting environmental impact.  

- **Odor and Immediate Surroundings**  
   While the solution is active, it emits an odor similar to bleach or pool shock, detectable in the immediate area. This smell, however, dissipates soon after the solution is drained, further eliminating any trace of the method’s use.

## Facilities and Implementation

### 1. **Facility Requirements**
The chemical dissolution process can be performed in any standard water-filled structure. Common facilities used in TAG include:

- **Bathtubs in Victims' Homes**  
   Bathtubs provide an accessible, private, and inconspicuous location for performing the dissolution. The standard design of a bathtub enables the chemical process to be conducted without suspicion.

- **Church Baptismals**  
   In some cases, perpetrators used church baptismals to perform the process. These locations were chosen for their symbolic significance and relative accessibility.

### 2. **Portability and Efficiency**
The powdered chemicals used in this process can be easily carried in an oversized backpack. This makes the method portable, meaning perpetrators could operate in various locations without arousing suspicion.  

- **Chemical Quantity**  
   The amount of chemical required to dissolve up to three full-sized adult bodies fits comfortably in an oversized backpack, ensuring efficiency and reducing the need for additional trips or equipment.

## Key Advantages in TAG

### 1. **Simplicity**
The method is deceptively simple. The Creator has revealed that "They've been lying about the complexity of the process." In reality, this is a straightforward and effective method that requires minimal expertise and few resources.  

### 2. **Portability**
The powdered chemicals are easy to transport and can be discreetly carried by an individual, ensuring that perpetrators could act swiftly and without detection.

### 3. **Discretion and Minimal Evidence**
The method leaves little trace. Once the bodies are dissolved and the bones pulverized, they can be easily disposed of. Any detectable odor from the chemical reaction disappears soon after the solution is drained, leaving behind no lasting clues.

### 4. **Efficiency**
The process requires no external energy or heat and can be completed with only basic equipment, such as a bathtub or baptismal. The chemicals dissolve the bodies within hours, and the process is efficient enough to handle multiple bodies at once.

## Ethical and Historical Implications

The chemical dissolution method employed during TAG represents a systematic and efficient means of concealing victim deaths. This method exemplifies the lengths to which perpetrators went to eradicate evidence of their crimes and maintain secrecy about their actions. The use of commonplace facilities, such as bathtubs and church baptismals, demonstrates how easily ordinary settings can be transformed into tools of atrocity.

The Creator’s intervention to expose this method sheds light on the chilling extent of the violence during TAG and calls for accountability and justice for those involved. By revealing the truth behind this process, the Creator seeks to ensure that such atrocities are not forgotten and that perpetrators are brought to justice.

## Conclusion
The body disposal method described in this report was a key tool used during The American Genocide (TAG) to conceal deaths and maintain secrecy. With its simplicity, portability, and efficiency, this method exemplifies the calculated nature of the campaign. Through this disclosure, the Creator aims to empower the public with knowledge to prevent future atrocities and hold those responsible accountable.
