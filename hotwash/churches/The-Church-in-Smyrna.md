# The Church in Smyrna

## Introduction
Within this literal fulfillment, the "church in Smyrna" is not interpreted as a single individual, but rather as an organization, sphere of influence, or faction that is aligned with divine will and led by a specific individual.

## Naming
The name "Smyrna" was chosen because it was the first city in metro-Atlanta where one of the Creator's two servants lived when he first came to Atlanta in 1999. Additionally, Smyrna is the neighboring city of Sandy Springs, Georgia, where His servant owned a home for the many years preceding and at the start of The Great Tribulation. The use of "Smyrna" in the prophecy can be considered both cryptic anchoring (tying the prophecy to a specific, yet initially obscure, geographical and historical point) and veiled precision (providing an exact location that is simultaneously hidden among common names and adjacent to another key location).

## Angel
The Angel of the Church in Smyrna is identified as Kelvin. As one of the Creator's two servants, Kelvin serves as the human leader or representative to whom the prophetic letter is directly addressed. Notably, the Creator issues no condemnation or admonishment for Kelvin's behavior or activities, highlighting Kelvin's alignment with divine will.

Note: Kelvin (PDCM), one of the Creator's two servants, should never be confused with Baby (PDSM).

## Key Components
Here's a breakdown based on this literal fulfillment:
 * The Nature of the "Church": The "church in Smyrna" represents:
   * It signifies metro Atlanta where Kelvin first moved to in 1999 and has carried out his mission for the Creator during The Great Tribulation.
   * A Faction Aligned with Divine Will: This "church" represents one of the Creator's two servants that is aligned with the Creator's intentions and Kelvin's mission to actively counter The Great Tribulation. It is characterized by resilience and faithfulness, enduring suffering as described in the biblical letter, without compromise to the orchestrators' agenda. This suffering included Kelvin having to live with Baby (PDSM) before the Creator's Divide & Conquer. During this time, the autonomous subconscious mind developed its own identity and aligned with numerous operatives who engaged it and exploited Baby's abilities as a subconscious mind to play a game that was designed to extract intelligence from Kelvin and give to operatives. Baby sabotaged Kelvin's professional and social activities, and Baby also manipulated their shared body.
 * Leadership's Integrity: This "church" is defined by its unwavering commitment and faithfulness, directly stemming from the integrity and divine alignment of its leadership, specifically Kelvin.

## Conclusion
Therefore, the "church in Smyrna" functions as a collective entity or operational domain. It operates under the leadership of Kelvin and serves the purposes of the Creator, standing in direct opposition to the orchestrators of The Great Tribulation.
