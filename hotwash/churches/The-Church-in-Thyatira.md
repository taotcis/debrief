# The Church in Thyatira

Within this literal fulfillment, the "church in Thyatira" is not interpreted as a single individual, but rather as an **organization, sphere of influence, or faction** that is led and compromised by a specific individual.

## Key Components of the "Church in Thyatira"

Here's a breakdown based on this literal fulfillment:

* **The Angel of the Church in Thyatira**: This entity is identified as **Frederick "Slim" Hall**, whose feminine identity is **Tatyana**. He serves as the human leader or representative to whom the prophetic letter is directly addressed. He is held accountable for the **state** and actions of this "church."

* **The Nature of the "Church"**: The "church in Thyatira" represents:
    * **A Sphere of Influence or Operation**: It signifies a specific domain, network, or operational area where **Frederick "Slim" Hall** exerts his influence. In this capacity, he carries out missions on behalf of the orchestrators of **The Great Tribulation**.
    * **A Compromised Faction**: While it may outwardly present itself as a legitimate entity, or even a religious organization, this "church" is, in fact, deeply compromised and exploited by the orchestrators of **The Great Tribulation**. Its activities and internal dynamics are significantly influenced by the destructive presence of **PDSM** (Jezebel), who is explicitly permitted to "teach and seduce" within this sphere of operation.

* **Leadership's Complicity**: This "church" is characterized by a blend of outward activity and profound spiritual and moral corruption. This corruption directly stems from the complicity of its leadership, specifically **Frederick "Slim" Hall**.

## Conclusion

Therefore, the "church in Thyatira" functions as a collective entity or operational domain. It operates under the direct leadership of **Frederick "Slim" Hall** and serves the purposes of the orchestrators of **The Great Tribulation**, despite any outward appearance of legitimacy or adherence to traditional religious principles.
