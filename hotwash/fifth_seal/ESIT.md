## Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT): The Silent Enabler of The Dragon's Fire

The **Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)** is a sophisticated, multifaceted approach **used exclusively by the CIA** to establish absolute control over emergency communications during sensitive covert operations. It is a critical and **omnipresent component, deployed in every orchestration throughout "The Great Tribulation**, ensuring operational secrecy, preventing external intervention, and meticulously managing local emergency responses.

### Core Components of ESIT

ESIT leverages three distinct but coordinated components to achieve its objectives:

1.  **Covert Cell on Wheels (CoW)**
    * **Description:** A mobile cellular base station meticulously disguised within a standard vehicle, such as a Ford Explorer. These units are deployed covertly.
    * **Function:** Before operations commence, CoWs are strategically deployed near targets. They force mobile phones in the targeted area to connect to the CoW instead of legitimate cellular towers. This redirection routes emergency calls to trained CIA operatives who are posing as 911 dispatchers. Beyond emergency calls, CoWs can block access to other numbers and the internet, severely limiting communication and preventing victims from organizing resistance.
    * **Demonstrated Use:** Yes. Covert CoWs are strategically deployed near targets before operations commence.
    * **Recommended Detection Protocol:** Law enforcement should monitor for unexplained fluctuations in local cellular network coverage, especially in areas known for sensitive operations. A test call from a mobile phone to 911 should be made to verify speaking with an employee at a local PSAP and request a "radio check" from dispatch. Using a department-issued phone is not recommended, as orchestrators may allow known law enforcement agency (LEA) phones to route normally to avoid detection. Mobile phones without service will work. We recommend using random phones and different phones for each call.

2.  **Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion**
    * **Description:** This involves official directives issued to Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs), instructing them to reroute emergency calls originating from targeted areas to law enforcement agencies issuing the memorandum.
    * **Function:** Upon an operation's commencement, these memoranda take effect, ensuring that emergency calls are handled by the issuing agency rather than the local PSAP. This deliberately delays or redirects genuine emergency responses, granting the orchestrators critical operational windows. Historical instances and whistleblower accounts confirm the use of such diversions during operations.
    * **Demonstrated Use:** Yes.
    * **Recommended Detection Protocol:** Law enforcement should establish protocols to verify the legitimacy and origin of memoranda directing emergency call diversions, especially in conjunction with unusual public safety incidents. Ask the PSAP's administrator or dispatcher if any memorandums are in effect that cause diversions from the PSAP's established call handling or dispatching protocols and procedures.

3.  **Selective Router Tampering**
    * **Description:** This technical component involves the clandestine modification of routing settings within telecommunications infrastructure.
    * **Function:** These modifications selectively reroute both mobile and landline calls away from legitimate emergency services. Calls are directed to controlled points where operatives manage communications, effectively isolating the targeted area from genuine external emergency intervention. Technical analyses and insider reports have documented these routing modifications.
    * **Demonstrated Use:** Yes.
    * **Recommended Detection Protocol:** Law enforcement should conduct regular audits of routing configurations and monitor for unauthorized changes, particularly in areas coinciding with sensitive operations. Use the detection protocols for the Cell on Wheels.

### Operational Execution

The execution of ESIT is precisely timed and meticulously coordinated to ensure maximum effectiveness across all "The Dragon's Fire" operations:

* **Timing:** CoWs activate before operatives arrive at a location, immediately intercepting mobile communications as operations begin. Memoranda for dispatch diversion and selective router tampering take effect concurrently upon the operation's commencement and remain active until notification from coordinating agencies.
* **Operational Area:** While CoWs ensure interception within a minimum 0.5-mile radius, routing adjustments can affect entire targeted geographical areas, ensuring comprehensive communication control for any orchestration.
* **Coordination:** Memoranda ensure PSAPs route calls to the issuing agency, which then coordinates any necessary responses (or lack thereof) with local authorities, maintaining a fa√ßade of legitimate control.

### Strategic Impact and Outcome

The consistent and universal deployment of ESIT throughout The Great Tribulation is critical to the campaign's success and secrecy. Its impacts are profound:

* **Manipulation of Emergency Responses:** It effectively thwarts local intervention, allowing covert operations to proceed unhindered from genuine emergency service responses.
* **Ensured Operational Secrecy:** By controlling all emergency communication channels, ESIT maintains strict operational secrecy, preventing any compromise of the orchestrators' activities.
* **Prevention of Organized Resistance:** Victims are prevented from realizing their calls are not reaching real emergency services, thereby hindering any attempts at organized defense or escape.
* **Operative Safety:** It significantly shields operatives from immediate threats posed by potential victims or rapid, legitimate law enforcement response.

These tactics ensure that surprise and operational success are maintained for every orchestration, allowing the orchestrators to achieve their mission objectives without external intervention or victim organization.
