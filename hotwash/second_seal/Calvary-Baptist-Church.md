# The Massacre at Calvary Baptist Church 
Calvary Baptist Church, located in Lexington, Kentucky, a predominantly white congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre on Mother's Day, May 12, 2024. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance, with the orchestrators disappearing without a trace. Over 400 people were killed. 

## Background
Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, KY, established in 1875, is a Christ-centered, caring church located at 150 East High Street. It offers both contemporary and traditional worship services and supports a variety of ministries for all age groups. The church is committed to community engagement and mission work, emphasizing progressive values such as embracing women in ministry and encouraging open discussion and education.

### Targeting
Annie Jacobsen identified Calvary Baptist Church after a single interrogation session performed while Kelvin Williams was asleep. Williams attended the daycare and preschool operated by Calvary Baptist Church in the early 1980s, which was just a couple of minutes away from his mother's office building at Kincaid Towers.

According to the Creator, Jacobsen gathered her intelligence herself by utilizing the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]].  No other intelligence-gathering activities were conducted by the CIA. 

Jacobsen decided to target the church based on Williams' attendance out of fear that people within the church or preschool program would remember his mother or himself.

## Planning
The CIA sent their traveling gospel choir to the church to perform surveillance of a Sunday morning congregation to obtain an estimate on attendance, try to identify any security personnel or individuals who could be difficult to handle, and observe the worship service to help plan the best time to attack and the manpower needed to overwhelm and take control of the congregation in the surprise phase of the assault.

To confirm the observations of their traveling choir, the CIA, at Jacobsen's direction, sent at least two operatives posing as visitors to a Sunday morning worship session in the month preceding the attack.

### Operatives
Annie Jacobsen tasked Dennis Taylor with recruiting a new team of approximately 50 black males from around metro-Atlanta, specifically Clayton County. According to the Creator, Jacobsen, Taylor, and their team utilized the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] aforementioned; however, the pool of possible recruits had been previously identified by the CIA as individuals who had the propensity to kill without provocation or other characteristics that made them suitable candidates. Those selected for the operation were later given roles with tasks they would be responsible for during the assault.

The use of black males was a requirement of Jacobsen's, intended to meet the planned narrative of a retaliatory attack for the assault on Mount Calvary Baptist Church, which the CIA planned to attribute to a white separatist group.

## Execution 
The operatives arranged their own transportation, many carpooling as instructed, and arrived in the Lexington metro area on the night before the attack. On the morning of the attack, beginning around 11 a.m., the operatives met outside the church. Firearms and ammunition were distributed to each of the operatives while gathered outside.

Taylor had an operative attend the morning worship session to provide him with information about the congregation and the service proceedings. Taylor and his operatives inside were in constant communication using text messaging.

Taylor directed the utilization of the [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] begin about five minutes before starting the assault. 

Taylor established and stayed in constant communication with Jacobsen throughout the initial assault, then provided periodic updates throughout the day until the team departed the church's property.

### Surprise
The congregation was already midway through their Sunday morning worship session when Taylor and operatives burst into the sanctuary. Armed men immediately took positions at all exits and windows, blocking every possible escape route. Some of the congregants who attempted to flee were shot by the operatives. Meanwhile, a small team of operatives conducted searches of the rest of the church's property, including the daycare and preschool areas.

Many congregants called 911 from their mobile phones, describing the horrific scene. They were told help was on the way, but none realized they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Lexington-Fayette County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)—a centralized facility responsible for answering and routing emergency calls--due to the FBI & CIA's [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]]. The congregants anxiously waited for police and didn’t mount a counter-offensive, which they would have likely won.

### Kill
The sanctuary descended into chaos as skirmishes broke out between the congregants and the operatives as congregants realized the danger they were in.

Congregants were forcibly separated from one another and taken to be shot. The operatives were not all skilled with firearms handling and had been provided little or no training on executions. Groups of congregants were assembled and shot haphazardly, many succumbing to their gunshot wounds hours later under a pile of those already dead. Some were found still alive when the cleanup process began and were shot again, not all were fatal gunshots. Some died hours later from blood loss.

### **Vanish**

Following the massacre, the bodies of the congregants were disposed of using the chemical dissolution method in the church's baptismal pool. Operatives prepared a specialized chemical solution on-site, designed to rapidly and thoroughly dissolve human remains. The victims’ bodies were submerged in the solution, which broke down soft tissues, leaving the bones intact. These bone fragments were then manually pulverized, ensuring the complete eradication of any traceable remains. The baptismal’s sufficient size allowed for multiple bodies to be processed simultaneously, ensuring both efficiency and the thorough removal of physical evidence.

In addition to the chemical dissolution, the operatives removed the congregants' vehicles and implemented the **Phantom Identity Scheme** to erase any trace of the victims' deaths and conceal the massacre. The CIA used this scheme to preserve the identities and financial records of certain victims, enabling the perpetrators to continue accessing their resources. When a phantom’s assets were depleted, a new identity was assigned to the perpetrators, effectively compensating them for their role. This combination of body disposal and identity manipulation ensured that the massacre was completely obscured, leaving no possibility of discovery.

## Aftermath 
The general public remains unaware of the true events, as more than 400 people simply vanished.
