## Congregation Massacres: A Pillar of Elimination in The Dragon's Fire

Within **"The Great Tribulation**—the overarching systematic elimination of groups and individuals—**Congregation Massacres** stand as a chilling and meticulously executed tactic. These are not random acts of violence but highly organized operations designed with the **sole intention of eliminating Christian congregations**, and then concealing the horrific truth of their disappearance. The orchestrators of "The Dragon's Fire" employ these massacres to fulfill their genocidal agenda, turning places of worship into sites of systematic eradication.

The Great Tribulation is a covert and systematic campaign of extermination that began on November 3, 2020. This campaign targets specific populations: Christians of all races, African Americans, the poor, the incarcerated, convicted criminals, military personnel, endowed males, and political dissenters. It has been orchestrated by high-ranking current and former U.S. government and CIA officials, with the goal of establishing an authoritarian regime led by Donald J. Trump as its supreme leader.

The core objective of a Congregation Massacre is the complete elimination of a congregation, often followed by sophisticated deception to ensure that victims "merely disappear" from public knowledge.

### Operational Characteristics:

* **Exclusive Targeting of Christians:** Congregation Massacres are **only intended to eliminate Christian congregations**. They directly target Christian faithful gathered within their churches. The primary aim is the annihilation of the entire congregation.
* **Designed and Managed by Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen:** The methodology for Congregation Massacres was **designed by Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen**, a key operative with an extensive background in psychological warfare. She has either personally **led or meticulously managed** each and every Congregation Massacre.
* **Ordered Execution Method: Beheading:** The execution method for Congregation Massacres is **beheading**, as personally ordered by "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen. Her rationale is chillingly pragmatic: to **guarantee the deaths of everyone** and to prevent executioners from fatiguing during the systematic slaughter.
* **Concealment, Not Chaos:** A defining characteristic of these operations is that the orchestrators are **not attempting to create chaos**. Instead, their goal is for victims to **"merely disappear."** This emphasis on concealment is paramount, ensuring that victims "merely disappeared" and that deceptive activities keep discussions or the disappearances to a minimum, preventing discovery and investigations by local or state authorities.
* **Victim Disposal: Chemical Dissolution:** The method of disposing of victims is **Chemical Dissolution**. The Creator has revealed that this process is **extremely simple**, requiring perpetrators to merely **add powdered chemicals to the water in the baptismal of the church to dissolve multiple bodies at once.** This efficiently ensures the complete disappearance of the victims.
* **Pivotal Role and Site Repurposing (Masquerade Churches):** Congregation Massacres **marked the beginning of the systematic elimination of Christians** within "The Dragon's Fire." After a massacre has eliminated the original congregation, the church properties are meticulously repurposed and renovated by the orchestrators to serve as **Masquerade Churches**.
    * **Strategic Reuse:** These sites are chosen for mass executions because of the **inherent trust people place in churches** and the **original congregation's established history in the community**. This built-in trust enables the orchestrators to lure new victims effectively. The Masquerade Churches established after Congregation Massacres have enabled the orchestrators to conduct **additional mass executions practically without detection**.
    * **Concealed Execution Facilities:** These sites are strategically prepared for hidden atrocities. As exemplified by Hickory Valley Christian Church, the properties often include renovated areas like school gymnasiums. These gymnasiums are specifically **upgraded for concealment**, designed to allow for **large queues of victims awaiting execution without people in the sanctuary or other public areas being aware** of the horrific activities unfolding within the concealed facility. **Hickory Christian Valley Church, in particular, is the most-reused site and the one with the most executions of all the Masquerade Churches.**

### Interconnected Operations:

Congregation Massacres are deeply integrated into the broader "The Dragon's Fire" campaign and are often followed by, or occur in conjunction with, other deceptive elimination tactics:

* **Phantom Identity Scheme:** This scheme is used to further obscure the deaths and the Congregation Massacres. It also serves to enrich the orchestrators and some perpetrators with the assets left behind by victims. This adds a clear financial incentive to the elimination and concealment efforts.
* **Direct Killing (Aftermath):** This involves the identification (using church records) and elimination of congregation members who were not present during the initial attack, as well as any individuals found residing in the homes of the deceased.
* **Phantom Funerals:** Staged funeral or memorial services are used as a lure to attract and eliminate associates of the massacre victims, under the guise of mourning or remembrance.
* **Phantom Pantry:** Deceptive operations utilizing the guise of charitable food distribution to attract and eliminate impoverished individuals. While not directly part of a Congregation Massacre's primary target, these may be run concurrently as broader elimination tactics on a repurposed site.
