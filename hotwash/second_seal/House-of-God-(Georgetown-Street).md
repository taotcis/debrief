# The Massacre at House of God (Georgetown Street)

House of God (Georgetown Street), located in Lexington, Kentucky, a predominantly African-American congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre in April 22, 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance, with the orchestrators disappearing without a trace. Over 300 people were killed.

## Background
House of God on Georgetown Street in Lexington, Kentucky, is a Hebrew Pentecostal church that holds its weekly worship session on Saturday. 

Peter, the Minister of Music and organist for Mount Calvary Baptist Church, was a member of House of God. Peter was at Mount Calvary on the day of the massacre and was killed. 

### Targeting
Annie Jacobsen identified House of God (Georgetown Street) as a serious threat after the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in April 2023. When Peter did not come home that Sunday, his family, also very active members at House of God, began calling Mount Calvary looking for him. 

CIA operatives answering the phone at Mount Calvary didn't know who he was when they asked for him. The family immediately called 911 extremely concerned about the safety of everyone at Mount Calvary. Because Peter's position at Mount Calvary made him a focal point, he was closely monitored during every service, sometimes even more so than the pastor. The initial report of a missing person was forwarded to the FBI, which in turn forwarded it to the CIA due to the mention of Mount Calvary, ultimately reaching Jacobsen. 

Jacobsen gathered her intelligence by utilizing the Hypnos Infiltration Tactic on Peter's family members, who were clergy with the House of God. No other intelligence-gathering activities were conducted by the CIA.

Jacobsen decided to target the church based on the family's ability to publicize the disappearances of not only their family member but also a well-known member of the neighborhood, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, and everyone else at Mount Calvary. 

## Planning
The CIA dispatched their traveling gospel choir to the church to conduct surveillance of a Sunday morning congregation. Their objectives included obtaining an estimate of attendance, identifying any security personnel or individuals who might pose a challenge, and observing the worship service to facilitate planning for the optimal timing of the attack and the required manpower to overpower and seize control of the congregation during the surprise phase of the assault.

### Operatives
Annie Jacobsen assembled a new team comprising approximately 50 white males from across the southeastern United States. According to the Creator, Jacobsen and her team employed the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] to validate or enhance the newly recruited men's proficiency in executing the attack operation.

## Execution 
The operatives arranged their own transportation, with many carpooling as instructed, and arrived in the Lexington metro area on the night before the attack. On the morning of the attack, beginning around 11 a.m., the operatives gathered outside the church. Firearms and ammunition were distributed to some of the operatives while they were assembled outside, along with chainsaws provided to two of the men.

Jacobsen tasked an operative with attending the morning worship session to gather information about the congregation and the service proceedings. Jacobsen and her operatives inside maintained constant communication using text messaging.

Jacobsen instructed that the utilization of the [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] begin about 15 minutes prior to launching the assault on the church. 

### Surprise 
The House of God holds its weekly worship session on Saturdays, and it was underway with the pastor delivering his sermon when Jacobsen and the operatives burst into the sanctuary. Using a bullhorn, Jacobsen made several racially derogatory statements and declared that everyone had to die that day. Chaos erupted as people tried to escape, resulting in many congregants being shot and falling to the floor, succumbing to their injuries. Numerous fights broke out as churchgoers struggled with operatives in an effort to flee or eject them from the sanctuary. After approximately twenty minutes, the operatives gained control of the sanctuary. Many congregants dialed 911 from their mobile phones to report the horrific scene, unaware that they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Lexington-Fayette County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) due to the FBI and CIA's [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]]. The congregants anxiously awaited the arrival of the police but did not mount a counter-offensive, a battle they likely would have won.

### Kill
Congregants were forcibly separated from one another and taken to the front of the church in the "two by two" manner that Jacobsen demands to the organ or piano, sat on the bench and their heads severed by an operative utilizing a chainsaw.  Some operatives kicked the heads around as if playing soccer.  

### **Vanish**

Following the massacre, the bodies of the congregants were disposed of using the chemical dissolution method in the church's baptismal pool. Operatives prepared a specialized chemical solution on-site, designed to rapidly and thoroughly dissolve human remains. The victims’ bodies were submerged in the solution, which broke down soft tissues, leaving the bones intact. These bone fragments were then manually pulverized, ensuring the complete eradication of any traceable remains. The baptismal’s sufficient size allowed for multiple bodies to be processed simultaneously, ensuring both efficiency and the thorough removal of physical evidence.

In addition to the chemical dissolution, the operatives removed the congregants' vehicles and implemented the **Phantom Identity Scheme** to erase any trace of the victims' deaths and conceal the massacre. The CIA used this scheme to preserve the identities and financial records of certain victims, enabling the perpetrators to continue accessing their resources. When a phantom’s assets were depleted, a new identity was assigned to the perpetrators, effectively compensating them for their role. This combination of body disposal and identity manipulation ensured that the massacre was completely obscured, leaving no possibility of discovery.

## Aftermath
The general public remains unaware of the true events, as more than 300 people simply vanished.
