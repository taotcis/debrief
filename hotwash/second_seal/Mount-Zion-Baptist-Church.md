# The Massacre of Mount Zion Baptist Church  
Mount Zion Baptist Church, located in Georgetown, Scott County, Kentucky, a predominantly Black congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre on May 21, 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance. The perpetrators disappeared without a trace, leaving the general public unaware of the true events, as 183 people simply vanished.  

## Background  
Mount Zion Baptist Church had a fellowship relationship with Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky.  

## Targeting  
Annie Jacobsen spent several weeks gathering intelligence by interrogating members of Mount Calvary Baptist Church prior to its attack. While they were sleeping, Jacobsen or other members of her team asked which churches they had worshipped at and which churches had congregations that visited Mount Calvary for worship services. Mount Zion Baptist Church's name was mentioned most frequently.  

Jacobsen gathered her intelligence using the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]].  

After the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Annie Jacobsen targeted Mount Zion Baptist Church out of a paranoid fear that the previous attack would be detected and the CIA's clandestine operation uncovered. This fear was based on assumptions about the relationship between the two congregations and possible friendships among their members.  

## Planning  
The CIA sent their traveling gospel choir to Mount Zion Baptist Church to perform surveillance during a Sunday morning worship session. The goal was to estimate attendance, identify any security personnel or individuals who might be difficult to subdue, and observe the worship service to determine the best time to attack and the manpower needed to overwhelm the congregation during the surprise phase of the assault.  

To confirm the choir's observations, the CIA, at Jacobsen's direction, sent at least two sets of visitors to Sunday morning worship services at Mount Zion on two separate occasions.  

## Operatives  
Annie Jacobsen assembled a new team of approximately 60 white males from across the southeastern United States. According to the Creator, Jacobsen and her team used the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] to validate or enhance the new recruits' proficiency in carrying out the operation.  

## Execution  
Jacobsen oversaw the entire operation from a nearby hotel room.  

The operatives arranged their own transportation, with many carpooling as instructed, and began arriving in the Lexington metro area the night before the attack. On the morning of the attack, starting around 11 a.m., the operatives met at a shopping center near the church and boarded a CIA-owned charter bus. The bus departed for the church around noon. Several shotguns, along with two chainsaws, were distributed to select operatives during transit, while others were given materials for their assigned roles.  

Jacobsen had an operative attend the morning worship session to provide her with real-time updates about the congregation and the service proceedings. She and the operative remained in constant communication via text messaging.  

The [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] was initiated just before the bus arrived at the church's property, per Jacobsen's direction.  

### Surprise  
The congregation was midway through their Sunday morning worship service when operatives burst into the sanctuary. Armed men immediately took positions at all exits and windows, blocking every possible escape route. Congregants who attempted to flee were shot. Meanwhile, a small team of operatives searched the rest of the church building.  

Many congregants called 911, describing the horrific scene. They were falsely assured that help was on the way, unaware that they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Scott County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)—the centralized facility responsible for handling emergency calls. Believing help was imminent, the congregants refrained from mounting a counteroffensive, which they might have otherwise won.  

### Kill  
The sanctuary descended into chaos as skirmishes erupted between the congregants and operatives once the congregation realized the imminent danger. Operatives armed with chainsaws were ordered to behead everyone in attendance.  

As the operatives gained control, they began forcibly escorting congregants to the church basement for execution. The method of execution was brutal and deliberate: the severing of heads with chainsaws. This grisly method had been employed in all attacks managed or led by Jacobsen.  

### **Vanish**

Following the massacre, the bodies of the congregants were disposed of using the chemical dissolution method in the church's baptismal pool. Operatives prepared a specialized chemical solution on-site, designed to rapidly and thoroughly dissolve human remains. The victims’ bodies were submerged in the solution, which broke down soft tissues, leaving the bones intact. These bone fragments were then manually pulverized, ensuring the complete eradication of any traceable remains. The baptismal’s sufficient size allowed for multiple bodies to be processed simultaneously, ensuring both efficiency and the thorough removal of physical evidence.

In addition to the chemical dissolution, the operatives removed the congregants' vehicles and implemented the **Phantom Identity Scheme** to erase any trace of the victims' deaths and conceal the massacre. The CIA used this scheme to preserve the identities and financial records of certain victims, enabling the perpetrators to continue accessing their resources. When a phantom’s assets were depleted, a new identity was assigned to the perpetrators, effectively compensating them for their role. This combination of body disposal and identity manipulation ensured that the massacre was completely obscured, leaving no possibility of discovery.

## Aftermath  
In the wake of the massacre, the CIA ensured that no loose ends remained, and all remaining members of Mount Zion Baptist Church who were not present on the day of the attack were systematically identified and eliminated to prevent any discussion or discovery of the operation.  

The church's sanctuary was completely renovated to hide all evidence of the massacre. Any physical traces of the attack were thoroughly erased, with walls rebuilt, floors replaced, and all remnants of blood or other physical evidence meticulously removed.  

A masquerade church was established in place of Mount Zion Baptist Church. This new church hosted numerous mass executions disguised as funerals or food pantries, further masking the true purpose behind the gatherings. These public events were part of a larger strategy to hide the massacre and prevent any discussion of the disappearances. Funerals were held for the victims, during which mourners were eliminated, while food pantries were used to lure and eliminate the impoverished. The entire operation projected a sense of normalcy to the surrounding community, ensuring that any suspicion of foul play was kept at bay.
