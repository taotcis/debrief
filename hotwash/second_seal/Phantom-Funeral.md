## Phantom Funerals: Deception and Elimination in The Dragon's Fire

Within the horrifying campaign of systematic elimination known as **"The Dragon's Fire," Phantom Funerals** serve as a sophisticated and deeply deceptive tactic, designed to lure, eliminate, and erase individuals who pose a threat or hold value to the orchestrators. These are not genuine acts of mourning, but **mass executions disguised as legitimate funeral or memorial services** to lure victims.

### Initial Design and Purpose: Concealing Massacres

Phantom Funerals were initially conceived with a crucial, insidious purpose directly linked to **Congregation Massacres**. Following the brutal eradication of Christian congregations, these staged services were designed to:

* **Prevent Discussions of Disappearances:** By providing a seemingly legitimate occasion for mourning, Phantom Funerals aimed to control the narrative around the sudden and unexplained absence of entire congregations. The fa√ßade of a funeral helped to rationalize the victims' disappearance in the public eye.
* **Prevent Discovery and Investigations:** By drawing in associates, friends, and family members of the massacre victims, these events served as controlled environments where these individuals could be covertly eliminated. This minimized the risk of outside parties discovering the true fate of the congregations or launching effective investigations.

### Evolution and Expanded Targeting:

Over time, the application of Phantom Funerals evolved beyond solely managing the aftermath of Congregation Massacres. Their effectiveness as a deceptive lure led the orchestrators to expand their use to target specific, high-value individuals or smaller groups who were deemed threats or held strategic importance. This evolution allowed for the systematic elimination of:

* **Military Personnel:** Those in positions of power, command structures, or influence who represent opposition to "The Dragon's Fire."
* **Politicians:** Those in positions of power or influence who represent opposition to "The Dragon's Fire."
* **Endowed Males:** Individuals specifically targeted for reasons related to their biological form.

### Operational Characteristics:

* **Exclusive Locations:** Phantom Funerals are **only held at locations where funerals are typically held and are under the direct control of the orchestrators.** These sites are **mostly Masquerade Churches**, but can include other controlled venues designed to appear as legitimate funeral homes or memorial sites.
* **Deceptive Staging:** Phantom Funerals are carefully constructed events, complete with all the outward appearances of genuine memorial services, exploiting the social norms of mourning and remembrance to make attendees vulnerable.
* **Total Elimination:** **Every mourner that attends a Phantom Funeral is eliminated.** Individuals are covertly removed and disposed of.
* **Concealment and Obfuscation:** Every aspect of a Phantom Funeral is designed to ensure the total eradication of the victim without leaving a trace, preventing any form of discovery or subsequent investigation by authorities.
* **Interconnection with Phantom Identity Scheme:** Critically, the **Phantom Identity Scheme** is interconnected with all operations that yield victims, including Phantom Funerals. This scheme not only serves to further **obscure the deaths** resulting from these operations but also functions to **enrich the orchestrators and some perpetrators with the assets left behind by victims.** This adds a clear financial incentive to the systematic elimination process.

### Instances and Applications:

Phantom Funerals are a pervasive tactic within "The Dragon's Fire" and have been employed in various contexts:

* **Post-Congregation Massacres:** These services are routinely established at **Masquerade Churches** (such as Hickory Valley Christian Church after its May 12, 2024 massacre) to eliminate associates of the annihilated congregations.
* **"Canyon Flood" Major Operation:** The "Canyon Flood" in Chattanooga, a large-scale, orchestrated **"flood of victims,"** explicitly served as a **long-running Phantom Funeral operation** (targeting political opposition) and Phantom Pantry operation (targeting the impoverished), utilizing the manufactured chaos and displacement as a cover for mass collection and elimination.

The calculated deployment of Phantom Funerals highlights the sophisticated and deeply sinister nature of "The Dragon's Fire," where even acts of solemn remembrance are perverted into tools of eradication and profit.
